# Bruce — HID I/O and rumble paths (session 2 decompilation)

Decompiled C for every function cited here is in `analysis/decomp/`. Ghidra project regenerable per `bruce-ghidra.md`.

## Confirmed

### HID input report transmit — `hid_input_target.cc` @ 0x60058aa8
Sends a HID input report. For a report of length ≥ 4: copies the report words into a global double-buffer (`DAT_60058b5c`), calls the transport send (`thunk_EXT_FUN_00007a2c(handle, 6, …)`), and on success writes **0x10000000 to a memory-mapped register `DAT_60058b60` followed by DSB/ISB** — i.e. rings a hardware "report ready" doorbell to kick the USB/DMA transmit. Small (<4 byte) reports take a separate formatting path.

### Rumble / haptics output path
- **`haptics_cluster.cc` @ 0x6006581c** — init/enable of the **two-motor cluster** (left + right). Zeroes both channel states (offsets 8/9 and 0x10/0x11), registers a timer callback (`obj+0x68`), and enables both actuators (`FUN_600d6c76` ×2) with "failed to enable left/right haptic" logging. Driven by a timer (`timer__60074658`).
- **`haptics.cc` @ 0x600656a0** — per-motor enable/disable/stop ("failed to enable/stop … haptic", `RumbleStop`).
- **`haptics.cc` @ 0x600655dc** — the strength scaler. Maps requested intensity (float 0..1) to a motor drive level with a floor, then **reads battery voltage over I2C** (`thunk_EXT_FUN_00001ea4(handle, reg=4, wbuf, 1, rbuf, 2, timeout=200)`) and **compensates the drive for battery level** (`drive = ref * level / Vbat`), clamped to a max. This is the "Failed to get battery voltage, can't scale haptics" code. Net effect: rumble feel stays consistent as the battery drains.

So the output path is: host HID output report (report ID 5, two u16 magnitudes) → timer-scheduled → `haptics_cluster` drives L/R motors → `haptics` scales each by battery-compensated intensity over I2C.

### Application state machine (from the state table initializer `FUN_600674d0` @ 0x600674d0)
The controller's internal states, revealed by the table's name strings: `RumbleNoLedChange`, `FactoryReset`, `Charging`, `ConnectedDim`, `PendingUserInput`, `CancelAutolink`, `CastError`, `DiscoveryFailed` (each entry = handler + name + params). Useful for mapping LED/behavior states later.

### USB *host* gamepad drivers
`switch_pro_controller.cc` @ 0x60070ad0+ is the USB-host driver that parses an *attached* Switch Pro controller (owns the "Ignoring report id: %u" / "Ignoring input report" strings). DualShock 3 and Steam Controller host drivers likewise present. (These are host-side, not the Stadia's own device reports.)

### ITCM-resident HAL primitives (analysis gap)
Pervasive calls like `thunk_EXT_FUN_00007a2c`, `thunk_EXT_FUN_00001ea4`, `thunk_EXT_FUN_0000737c`, `thunk_EXT_FUN_0000b572` target low addresses (0x0000xxxx) that are **not in the static flash image** — hot HAL/RTOS routines copied into ITCM at boot. Signatures inferred from call sites: `00001ea4` = I2C transfer `(handle, reg, wbuf, wlen, rbuf, rlen, timeout)`; `00007a2c` = a bus/queue transaction `(handle, cmd, arg, out, timeout)`. To recover these, next step is to find the boot-time ITCM copy (memcpy of a flash blob → 0x00000000 region) and map that blob.

## Corrections to earlier assumptions
- **`keys.cc` is a typed config key-value store, NOT gamepad buttons.** `keys__60066070` = `Get(key_id, out, size)` with a switch on value-type. The physical button/stick sampling path is elsewhere and still unmapped.

## Open / next targets
- **Gamepad input source**: how buttons (GPIO/matrix), sticks & triggers (ADC) are sampled and assembled into HID **report ID 3**. `hid_input_target.cc` sends it; the producer is TBD.
- **`FUN_6004cdb8`** (15.6 KB, near image start) — still unread; likely a major event/dispatch loop.
- **Map ITCM blob** to resolve the `thunk_EXT_FUN_0000xxxx` HAL primitives.
- Recover the incoming HID **output report** parser (report ID 5 → the haptics call) end to end.
